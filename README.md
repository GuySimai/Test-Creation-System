I developed a system in Java using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create and manage exams. Throughout the process, I gained a deeper understanding of OOP concepts, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The project also involved working with text files and binary files for storing questions, answers, and results, which enhanced my skills in file handling and data management in Java.
